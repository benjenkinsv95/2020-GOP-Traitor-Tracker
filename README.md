# 2020-GOP-Traitor-Tracker

An extension that keeps track of the traitors that tried to overthrow the 2020 election by disenfranchising the voters of 4 entire states. 

Currently the extension is under review, but if you'd like to use it I have uploaded it here. [`2020-GOP-Traitor-Tracker.zip`](2020-GOP-Traitor-Tracker.zip)

[Here are some shorts steps](https://ui.vision/howto/install-chrome-extension-from-file) for setting it up.
